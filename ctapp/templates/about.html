          <p>Jason Ost and Colin Gerber are students in the <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims" target="_blank">Master of Information Management and Systems (MIMS)</a> program at UC Berkeley's <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">School of Information</a>. This website is our <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims/projects" target="_blank">final project</a> for the program.</p>
          <p>We decided to work with the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> database becuase we saw a significant opporunity for positive public impact and a lot of room for data quality improvement, which is something that interests both of us. Currently the clinical trial data is not well-structured (most of the important data is in the form of free text), which results in information access and retrieval problems. This project attempts to improve the data quality, the ease of access, and the ability to structure the data going forward.</p>
